One day Gerry was late to class
Because he wanted to stop and get some coffee before class. EDIT: Gerry likes to run to Cafe Louis before his 8 am class on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays. He knows the baristas by name and he looks forward to talking with them in the morning. 
Unfortunately, this time wouldn't be the last. EDIT: Gerry is actually very punctual. I just wanted to rhyme this line (and half rhyme this sentence).
Again, he tried to do everything fast
His favorite is a pumpkin spice latte
With a nice apple tart
and an excessive amount of whipped cream
He strutted into class with white and green cup in hand
Odd flex but ok
Ya boi always flexes on dem hataz
